## Hi, I'm Marcin.

When I started working as a Process Engineer (early 2018), a large part of my job consisted of calculating production capacity and work loads, and this was how my Excel journey started. I was surprised to discover that I actually really enjoy working with rows and rows of data. I have learned a lot about formulas, pivot tables, and then VBA and PowerQuery, soon becoming my workplace's *Excel guy*. For a long time, it became my primary Swiss-knife tool for solving a wide variety of problems, including some that Excel was most likely not designed to solve (thanks, VBA).

Later on, I added PowerBI and SQL to my toolbox, which opened a new world of possiblities.

Currently I'm learning Python (starting with the classics such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn), aiminig to integrate it in my work.
