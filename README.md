## Hi, I'm Marcin.

When I started working as a Process Engineer, I right away found out how useful Excel can be. I've learned quite a lot about pivot tables, and then VBA and PowerQuery, soon becoming "the local Excel guy". From there, I incorporated PowerBI and SQL in my toolbox, and currently I'm exploring the possibilities of Python (mostly numpy. matplotlib, pandas, Seaborn).
