## Hi, I'm Marcin.

When I started working as a Process Engineer in steel constructions manufacturing (early 2018), a large part of my job consisted of calculating production capacity and work loads, and so I spent a lot of time with Excel. To make things more efficient, I studied formulas, pivot tables, VBA, and PowerQuery, soon becoming my workplace's *resident Excel person*. It became my primary Swiss-knife tool for solving a wide variety of problems, including some that Excel was most likely not designed to solve (thanks, VBA). As more and more of my daily tasks were involving data analysis, I turned my attention to PowerBI and SQL. Adding those to my toolbox opened a new world of possiblities.

Currently, I'm learning Python in my free time (starting with the classics such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn), aiminig to integrate it in my work. I'm also steadily improving my proficiency with PowerBI, SQL and Excel.
