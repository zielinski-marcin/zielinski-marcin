## Hi, I'm Marcin.

When I started working as a Process Engineer, I right away found out how useful Excel can be. Over time, I have learned a lot about formulas, pivot tables, and then VBA and PowerQuery, soon becoming my workplace's *Excel guy*. For a long time, it became my primary tool for solving a wide variety of problems, including some that Excel was definitely not designed to solve, thanks to VBA.  

A bit more recently, I added PowerBI and SQL to my toolbox, and currently I'm exploring the possibilities of Python (starting with the classics like numpy. matplotlib, pandas, Seaborn).
